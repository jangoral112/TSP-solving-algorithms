# TSP solving algorithms

This repository contains implementation of three algorithms that solves traveling salesman problem for given set of cities in cartesian plane: 

- burte force
- held-karp 
- nearest neighbor

`create_cities_coordinates` function from [generator.py](https://github.com/jangoral112/TSP-solving-algorithms/blob/main/generator.py) can be used to generate set of cities.

[main.py](https://github.com/jangoral112/TSP-solving-algorithms/blob/main/main.py) contains example which compares execution times for each of algorithms to solve TSP with generated sets of cities.
